# Clustering-Text-Analytics-Social-Networks
Analytics Projects on various topics: Clustering, Text Analytics, Social Networks

These are some short projects I made using several methods: Clustering (Hierachical and K-means), Text Analytics and Social Networks. They focus on understanding and visualizing data. 

All projects are completed in R. I am uploading both the .Rmd file and a pdf of the end notebook.

Unfortunately the data is not public and so the code cannot be run as-is.
